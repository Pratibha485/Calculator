# Calculator
This web page features a simple and functional calculator, designed to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator is implemented using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the interactive functionality.

The HTML file defines the layout of the calculator, including a display area and buttons for digits (0-9), operations (+, -, *, /), and functionalities like clear (C) and equals (=). The calculator's interface is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with buttons arranged in a familiar layout.

CSS is used to style the calculator, making it visually appealing and easy to use. The buttons are styled with hover effects for better user experience, and the display area is designed to clearly show the input and result.

JavaScript handles the calculator's functionality. It captures user inputs, performs the calculations, and updates the display. Event listeners are attached to the buttons to handle clicks, and a simple logic is implemented to process the arithmetic operations and display the result.

This calculator is a great example of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be combined to create a useful web application. It serves as a practical tool and a demonstration of basic web development skills, including DOM manipulation and event handling.
